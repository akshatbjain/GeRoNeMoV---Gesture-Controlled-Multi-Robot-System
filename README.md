# GeRoNeMoV - A Gesture Controlled Multi-Robot System

In a world where Human-Robot Interaction is undeniably necessary to accomplish tasks, GeRoNeMoV is a tool that allows a single human user to interact with an control large robotic systems with ease. 

The system incorporates vision-based multi-robot control algorithms and machine learning to recognize and recreate (using multiple mobile robots) shapes drawn in the air by the user. 

Other features include:

-Individual Robot Control: Individually identified robots navigate a define path "air drawn" by the user.
- Point and Move: The user can point at the location where the robot needs to be moved.
- Point and Assault (a feature exclusive to a military battalion formation): Robots Align themselves towards the location pointed out by the user (and essentially concentrate their fire if pre-fitted with weapons).

The name GeRoNeMoV was inspired by the different domains that this project touches:
* Ge - Gesture
* Ro - Robot
* Ne - Neural Networks
* Mo - Motion
* V - Vision
